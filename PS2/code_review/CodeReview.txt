- Make package name a bit more descriptive

Address.java :
- The author made getters and setters to set the value of the Address Entry, which makes it prone to changes using the setters and thus not avoiding mutability.
- Author does not use builder class to create the address object which is considered to be the best practice in these types of classes
- The author failed to override the hash code function which is required in the case these address objects are ever being stored in a hash type of object example hashmap or hashset
- No null checking in any of the setters (Line 67,75,83,91)
- Extra blank lines (Example Line 118,135,142 )
